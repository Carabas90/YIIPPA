## YIIPPA ( Yale Insulin Infusion Protocol Python Application)
### (Worst name ever, I know)

This is a Python Application to computerize the [Yale Insulin Ifusion Protocol](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Yale-Insulin-Infusion-Protocol_fig1_7774851).
It uses Tkinter as a GUI-Framework and all Data is saved in CSV-Files, that are anonymized and archived when a Patient is removed from the Application. Long-term goal for this Apllication would be 
to use the collected Data to optimze the Protocol in a way, that an optimal insulin rate (meaning a stable blood glucose level between 100-180 mg/dl) for the Patient is found in as few steps as possible.

## Disclaimer:
This Application is a pure study project and should never be used in an actual hospital setting.
Neither is this Protocol suitable for the Treatment of a Diabetes outside of the special setting
of an ICU. **The Use of this Application to treat your, or someone elses Diabetes might cause severe harm or even death**.
